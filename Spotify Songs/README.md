# About

This analysis will look at whether acousticness, danceability, duration in milliseconds, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time signature, and valence influences popularity. I looked at the basic data of each variable, the scatterplot of each paired variable, the correlation matrix, the linear models of all predictor variables and then of those with removed variables, and the residual plots of my final model. Based on the conclusion of those observations I chose the model that would best predict popularity in a song. The model that best fit was a model that removed key even though there were other insignificant variables that was the only one that improved the R-Squared.
